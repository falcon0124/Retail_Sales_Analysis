# Retail Sales Performance Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Objective
Analyze retail sales data to identify top-performing products, regional performance, and sales trends, and present findings in an interactive dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for visualization
- **Dataset**: Superstore Sales Dataset (Kaggle)

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Advanced Copier** generates 2x more revenue than the second highest-selling product.
- **Eastern & Western regions** record the highest orders, while the Central region shows moderate performance.
- **Sales peak in August, November, and December**, indicating strong seasonal demand.
- **Optimal profit margins** occur at ~20% discount; deeper discounts don’t yield proportional profit.
